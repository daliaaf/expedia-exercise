-This application was built in a PHP language.
I have chosen PHP language for several reasons:
-	PHP is simple and dynamic language, and good choice for this application.
-	Currently I am working as integration engineer and develop application using Mule ESP (Java based), so I donâ€™t have experience in any of the listed languages (I worked in MVC .net and this was not an option).
-	This is my first application in PHP.
